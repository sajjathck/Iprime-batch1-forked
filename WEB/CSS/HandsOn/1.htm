        Islamic conquests made limited inroads into modern Afghanistan and Sindh as early as the 8th century,[7]
        followed by the invasions of Mahmud Ghazni.[8] The Delhi Sultanate was founded in 1206 CE by Central Asian Turks
        who ruled a major part of the northern Indian subcontinent in the early 14th century, but declined in the late
        14th century,[9] and saw the advent of the Deccan sultanates.[10] The wealthy Bengal Sultanate also emerged as a
        major power, lasting over three centuries.[11] This period also saw the emergence of several powerful Hindu
        states, notably the Vijayanagara Empire and Rajput states. The 15th century saw the advent of Sikhism.
